# 🏦 Loan Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on applicant information. It is built using Python and scikit-learn and is intended as a demonstration of binary classification for financial data.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions receive numerous loan applications daily. Predicting loan eligibility based on applicant details can improve decision-making and reduce defaults.

**Goal:** Build a model that classifies loan applications as `Approved` or `Rejected`.

## 🛠️ Model Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Understand distributions, correlations, and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Transform and scale numerical variables.

4. **Model Training**  
   Use classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

5. **Evaluation**  
   Assess with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

6. **Model Saving and Inference**  
   Save trained model using `joblib` and create a prediction script.
